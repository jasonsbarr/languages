# Inference

A simple type inference engine based on Luca Cardelli's 1987 paper [Basic Polymorphic Typechecking](http://lucacardelli.name/Papers/BasicTypechecking.pdf), which presents a simplified version of Hindley-Damas-Milner type inference.

See also the F# version by [Dave Thomas](https://github.com/7sharp9/write-you-an-inference-in-fsharp/blob/master/HMBasic/HMBasic.fs) and Python by [Rob Smallshire](https://github.com/rob-smallshire/hindley-milner-python/blob/master/inference.py).
