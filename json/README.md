# JSON Parser

A simple interpreter that turns valid JSON strings into JavaScript objects by way of an abstract syntax tree.

Yes, the AST is a bit of overkill, but I'm focused on the process more than the result right now.

Obviously in a real project you'd just use `JSON.parse`, but this is a learning project.

Throws an error on invalid input.

Implementation language: JavaScript.
